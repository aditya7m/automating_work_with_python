# This code can be run as it is (just run it) on any Debian based distro.
# But it can also be used to run on any other Operating System by just
# changing the mypath variable to your desired folder which you want to
# clean up.

# It's not a plain desktop cleaner, what it does is it checks for the file
# extension name and collect all files with same extension to a folder named
# like extension.

# For e.g. files with pdf extension all in one folder named pdf, files with jpg
# extension all in one folder named jpeg.
